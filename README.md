# YouTube Timestamp Bookmarker

YouTube is one of the main sources of entertainment for people as of late. We often re-watch videos to see the best parts or the parts we like the most. This can be easy with a Google Chrome extension to bookmark timestamps.

When the extension used on a YouTube video page, saved timestamps are displayed in a list. Adding a timestamp is as simple as clicking the *Add Bookmark* button, which will add the current time of the video to the list. Clicking on the timestamps will seamlessly go to that point in time in the video.
